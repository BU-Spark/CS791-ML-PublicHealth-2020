# Project: Understanding the Determinants of Health

BU School of Public Health has access to clinician notes collected during routine medical visits at the Boston Medical Center. These notes are written free-text reports of visits capturing the clinicianâ€™s findings, observations, and diagnoses.
We need to predict a diagnosis of substance abuse, alcohol use and tobacco smoking from the data in the notes by using techniques such as NLP and machine learning methods. 

<br/>
<br/>

# PROBLEM / OBJECTIVE:  
Using the patients records, predict diagnosis of:  
. substance abuse   
. alcohol use   
. tobacco smoking  

Different patients with different background can have different response to diseases. So, information extraction for above 3 phenotypes would help in cohort studies in HIV and Hepatitis C.

# Methods:
## Method 1 - MedCAT (Medical Annotation Tool)  
## Method 2 - 3 machine learning models (kNN, Naive Bayes, Linear SVC)
